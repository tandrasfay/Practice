# Practice
========

This repository is for practicing markdown, cloning, forking, etc.


## Markdown Practice

To strikethrough text, add two ~ on each side of the text.  
 Example: The capital of California is ~~Los Angeles~~ Sacramento.
 
 
 To add code blocks, place three backwards ' at beginning and end of code block. If you wish to
  specify the language, you can type it after the third ' before the code block.
```
sudo apt-get install ipython ipython-notebook python-pip
```

A really useful command for virtual box:
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/tandrasfay/questionnaire
```
It will clone the entire repository to the virtual machine so that you have the files you need.


## Python Practice

To run date and time, you must first import the datetime functionality:

``` python
from datetime import datetime
```
