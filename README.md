## Markdown Practice

To strikethrough text, add two ~ on each side of the text.  
 Example: The capital of California is ~~Los Angeles~~ Sacramento.
 
 
 To add code blocks, place three backwards ' at beginning and end of code block. If you wish to
  specify the language, you can type it after the third ' before the code block.
```
sudo apt-get install ipython ipython-notebook python-pip
```
